# GoodRecipes App

Welcome to the GoodRecipes application, a Part II of my Portfolio Project. This fullstack web application allows users to view, manage, and share recipes, making cooking and meal planning easier. I used "Recipe Search and Diet by Edaman" to fetch recipes based on user input. GoodRecipes is viewable on different screen sizes.
